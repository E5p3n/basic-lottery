Just run it in the terminal,
the program will then ask for the amount of players, then for the amount of prizes, before it will start sing-up.
During the sign-up it will ask for a name followed by the amount of tickets the player has,
then repeat these questions according to the amount of players.
After the sign-up is done it will print out a winner after each enter press.
